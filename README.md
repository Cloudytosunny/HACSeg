## 📝 Introduction
HACSeg focuses on the intrinsic geometric properties of LiDAR point clouds to achieve robust panoptic segmentation without the need for extensive training. 


## 🛠️ News
- **[2026/02]**: Code cleanup is in progress.
- **[Coming Soon]**: We will release the full source code, environment setup guide, and evaluation scripts on SemanticKITTI / nuScenes datasets.

## 📅 Roadmap
- [ ] Release core clustering algorithm (C++/Python)
